        <h1>Monica Royster</h1>
        <h2>Front-End Developer + Designer</h2>

        <p>I'm a well-rounded business and tech-savvy person that likes to develop and design. My heart is in front-end
          development, but I have newly gained full-stack proficiencies in Web Fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript),
          MERN,
          C#, and
          Python. I have strong communication and organizational skills. I'm an efficient problem solver, and an expert
          at
          searching the internet. I have a business mindset which allows me to bridge gaps in an agile team framework,
          or
          I can
          work independently. Working from home is desired, but I'm open to relocating to a major city.
